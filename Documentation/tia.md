Contribution: Developed ANN Model


* Preprocessed the data: imported training and testing sets for each company.
* Created and customized each layer: Created input layer, 3 hidden layers, and output layer, then customized them with the specific amount of neurons and input variables needed to match our study.
* Incorporated Adam optimizer to more efficiently update the model parameters during training.
* Scaled the input data, fit model to the training sets, and predicted the test set results for each companyâ€™s stock closing prices and expected error values.
* Implemented plotting feature to display a visualization of model.

* Complete code with output found here: [Corporation Data/ANN Model Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tia-kun/stock-price-prediction-model/blob/main/Corporation%20Data/.ipynb_checkpoints/ANN%20Model%20Code.ipynb)
